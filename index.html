    <h1>Information About Siberian Husky's</h1>
    <img src="images/siberian-husky.jpg" alt="Image Of a Siberian Husky" height="400" width="">
    <p>The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled dog breed.
       The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family.
       It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings,
      and is smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute</p>

    <p>Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia for sled pulling, and companionship.
       It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic.
       William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain.
       Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house pet,
       though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by competitive and recreational mushers.</p>
