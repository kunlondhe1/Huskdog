    <h1>Information About Dog's</h1>
    <p>The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the grey wolf. It has many notable characteristics, the most prominent of which is the upturning tail.
      The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf. Today, the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.
      Experts assert that the dog was the first species to be domesticated. It is believed that domestication took place over 15,000 years ago and was performed by hunterâ€“gatherers before the development of agriculture.</p>
    <p>The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
      Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police
      and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people.
      This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend."</p>
